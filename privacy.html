            <p>Effective: March 21, 2024</p>
            <hr />

            <p class="intro">
                When you use InPubliq, you trust us with your personal data.
                We're committed to keeping that trust. That starts with helping
                you understand our privacy practices. This policy describes the
                personal data ("data") we collect, how it's used and shared, and
                your choices regarding this data. We recommend that you read
                this along with our
                <a href="terms">Terms of Service</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
            <p>InPubliq collects the following types of data:</p>

            <h3>Data you provide us</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    When you create an account, you provide us with your phone
                    number as well as your gender and date of birth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    With your consent, we collect precise geolocation data
                    (latitude and longitude) from your device if and only if the
                    InPubliq app is running in the foreground (app open and
                    on-screen). We do not update location data when the app is
                    running in the background (app open but not on-screen). If
                    the app has not been in the foreground for 10 minutes, your
                    account is set to "Ghost Mode", where your last location is
                    no longer visible by other users, even those at the same
                    public address. If you decline permission for us to collect
                    your precise geolocation, you will not be able to use the
                    app.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When you use our app, we collect data about your activity
                    including when you logged in, which features you've used,
                    and how you've used them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As mentioned in the
                    <a href="terms">Terms of Service</a>, we process the content
                    of the semi-public wall chats, while direct messages are
                    end-to-end encrypted and not accessible to us.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We collect data from and about the device(s) you use to
                    access our app, including hardware and software data such as
                    IP address, device ID and type, apps settings and
                    characteristics, and app crashes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When you communicate with us (via email or on social media)
                    we collect the data you give us during that communication.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data we receive from others</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Users:</strong> Other users may provide data about
                    you when they use our app, for instance as they interact
                    with you or if they submit a report involving you.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Social Media:</strong> When you create an account,
                    you log in with an existing social media account. We receive
                    data from that social media account, such as your name,
                    email address, and profile picture.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>With other users</h3>
            <p>
                You share information with other users when you voluntarily
                disclose information on the app (including your public profile).
                If someone submits a report involving you (such as a claim that
                you violated our <a href="terms">Terms of Service</a>), we may
                communicate to the reporter actions, if any, we took as a result
                of their report.
            </p>

            <h3>With law enforcement / when required by law</h3>
            <p>
                We may disclose your information if reasonably necessary: (i) to
                comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or
                search warrant, government / law enforcement investigation or
                other legal requirements; (ii) to assist in the prevention or
                detection of crime (subject in each case to applicable law); or
                (iii) to protect the safety of any person.
            </p>

            <h3>To enforce legal rights</h3>
            <p>
                We may also share information: (i) if disclosure would mitigate
                our liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit; (ii) as
                necessary to protect our legal rights and legal rights of our
                users; (iii) to enforce our agreements with you; and (iv) to
                investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal
                activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Your Rights and Choices</h2>

            <h3>Device permissions</h3>
            <p>
                We require mobile device location services permissions to
                provide our app experience. We need to access your location to show you
                users nearby. You can disable location sharing by toggling off
                the InPubliq switch and turning on "Ghost Mode". In this
                setting, your location is not visible to other users and you
                cannot see other users' locations.
            </p>

            <h3>Uninstall</h3>
            <p>
                You can stop all data collection by uninstalling it using the
                standard uninstall process for your device. Remember that
                uninstalling an app does NOT close your account. To close your
                account, please use the corresponding functionality on the app.
            </p>

            <h3>Account closure</h3>
            <p>
                You can close your account by using the corresponding
                functionality directly on the app.
            </p>

            <h2>5. How Long We Retain Your Data</h2>
            <p>
                We store data as long as it is necessary to provide our app

                    your account as a precautionary measure in the event that it
                    becomes necessary to investigate unlawful behavior.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After three months, we delete your data except:

                            legal requirements
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Records of consents users give us as evidence of our

            <p>
                Our app is restricted to users who are 18 years of age or older.
                We do not permit users under the age of 18 on our platform. If

                We will notify you before we make changes to this policy and
                give you the opportunity to review the revised policy before you
                choose to continue using our app.
