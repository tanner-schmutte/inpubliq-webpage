            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            <p>Effective: March 21, 2025</p>
            <hr />

            <p class="intro">
                By using InPubliq's mobile application (the "App"), you agree to
                be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms").
            </p>

            <h2>1. Who May Use the App</h2>
            <p>
                You may use the App only if you agree to form a binding contract
                with us and are not prohibited from doing so under the laws of
                the applicable jurisdiction. In any case, you must be at least
                18 years old to use the App. If you are accepting these Terms
                and using the App on behalf of a company, organization,
                government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant
                that you are authorized to do so and have the authority to bind
                such entity to these Terms, in which case the words “you” and
                “your” as used in these Terms shall refer to such entity.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to the above requirements, you agree not to use any
                technology or means to alter, mask, or falsify your geographic
                location or to spoof your location while using the App.
                Utilizing location spoofing techniques to deceive the App or
                other users about your actual location is strictly prohibited
                and constitutes a breach of these Terms. Any attempt to bypass
                our location verification mechanisms may result in immediate
                termination of your account and access to the App.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                Our
                <a href="privacy">Privacy Policy</a>
                describes how we handle the information you provide to us when
                you use the App. You understand that through your use of the App

            <h2>3. Content and Conduct on the App</h2>
            <h3>Content Responsibility</h3>
            <p>
                You are responsible for the content you create, share, or post
                on the App, including texts, photos, videos, and any other types
                of media or communication ("Content"). You agree that any
                Content you provide on the App complies with all applicable
                laws, respects intellectual property rights, and does not
                infringe on the rights of third parties. You are solely
                responsible for the Content you post and the consequences of
                sharing it.

            <h3>Acceptable Use</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Walls:</strong> All content posted to semi-public
                    walls within the App will be subject to moderation to ensure
                    compliance with our community standards and these Terms.
                    InPubliq reserves the right, but not the obligation, to
                    monitor and remove any content deemed in violation of these
                    Terms, without prior notice to the user.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Icebreakers and Direct Messages:</strong> The App
                    offers end-to-end encrypted direct messaging to protect the
                    privacy of your communications with other users. While
                    direct messages are encrypted and not accessible to InPubliq
                    for moderation, users are encouraged to report any abusive
                    or inappropriate behavior encountered during direct
                    communications. Users have the ability to block other users
                    to prevent further direct contact.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Blocking and Reporting</h3>
            <p>
                We provide tools to report offensive Content and to block
                abusive users. If you encounter Content that violates these
                Terms or find someone's behavior towards you or others
                inappropriate, we encourage you to use the reporting and
                blocking features within the app. We will review reported
                Content in a timely manner and take appropriate action.
            </p>

            <h3>Intellectual Property Rights and Content Licensing</h3>
            <p>
                When you post Content on the App on your own wall or as
                contributions to others' walls, you retain all rights in, and
                are solely responsible for, the Content you post. By posting
                Content to the App, you grant InPubliq a non-exclusive,
                royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide license to
                use, store, display, reproduce, and distribute your Content
                within the App solely for the purposes of operating, developing,
                providing, and using the App. This license enables us to
                facilitate the functioning of the App, including making your
                Content available on the App and allowing the display and
                promotion of your Content in accordance with these Terms.
            </p>

            <p>
                For Content you post on your own wall, this license includes
                allowing you to access your past walls, including all posted
                Content, on a read-only basis after these walls have expired, in
                accordance with our Content and Conduct policies.
            </p>
            <p>
                For Content you contribute to others' walls, this license
                extends to making your Content available as part of those walls,
                including providing the wall owner with read-only access to the
                expired wall and its Content. However, as a contributor to
                someone else's wall, you will not have access to view your
                Content on that wall once it has expired. The ability to access
                and review your Content post-expiration is reserved solely for
                the owner of the wall to which the Content was contributed.
            </p>
            <p>
                This licensing arrangement does not grant InPubliq the right to
                modify your Content or to sell or distribute it outside of the
                the App.
            </p>

            <h3>Content Removal</h3>
            <p>
                In addition to the rights granted, InPubliq reserves the right
                to review and, if necessary, remove any Content posted on the
                App that violates our platform's content policies or is
                otherwise deemed harmful to the community. This is to ensure a
                safe and respectful environment for all users.
            </p>

                except as otherwise agreed by the parties. You agree to submit
                to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Texas
                for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.

            <h3>Arbitration Option</h3>
            <p>
                For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other
                equitable relief) where the total amount of the award sought is
                less than $10,000, the party requesting relief may elect to
                resolve the dispute through binding non-appearance-based
                arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted in Texas in
                accordance with the American Arbitration Association's rules.
                Each party shall bear its own costs and disbursements arising
                out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees
                and costs of the ADR Provider.
            </p>
            <h3>Class Action Waiver</h3>
            <p>
                YOU AND INPUBLIQ AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE
                OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, and not as a
                plaintiff or class member in any purported class or
                representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and InPubliq
                agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than
                one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form
                of a representative or class proceeding.
